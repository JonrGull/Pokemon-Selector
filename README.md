# Pokemon-Selector

This is a collaboration project with mikemasatsugu && tristach

It is a work in progress where the user will be able to answer several questions that narrow down their choice of pokemon to a single or similar pokemon that match that criteria.

Created using JavaScript, React, MUI, and API calls, you can search for a Pokemon that you're looking to choose. If you find one that you're looking for, click on it! Or you can answer all the questions and a few may be chosen for you!
