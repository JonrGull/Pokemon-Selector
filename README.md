# Pokemon-Selector

This is a collaboration project with mikemasatsugu && tristach

It is a work in progress where the user will be able to answer several questions that narrow down their choice of pokemon to a single or similar pokemon that match that criteria.

A JSON file holds all of the pokemon data that we plan to use. Using a combination of React and JavaScript, we plan to turn this into a simple, yet fun project to improve our skills. We don't know how long it will take to finish, but hopefully it doesn't take too long!

Start date: August 2021
